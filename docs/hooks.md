# Hook System

OpenIsland receives hook events from AI agents (Codex / Claude Code / Gemini CLI) via the `OpenIslandHooks` CLI. The CLI forwards payloads to the app over a Unix socket and, when necessary, writes a directive back to stdout so the agent can act on it (e.g. block a tool call).

## Architecture

```
Agent (Codex / Claude Code / Gemini CLI)
  │  stdin: JSON payload
  ▼
OpenIslandHooks CLI  (--source codex | --source claude | --source gemini)
  │  Unix socket
  ▼
BridgeServer → AppModel → UI
  │  BridgeResponse
  ▼
OpenIslandHooks CLI
  │  stdout: JSON directive (only when a response is needed)
  ▼
Agent
```

**Fail-open principle**: if the bridge is unavailable the hook process exits silently without writing to stdout, so the agent continues running unaffected.

## Skip Hooks For Delegated Control

Set `OPEN_ISLAND_SKIP_HOOKS=1` on a child agent process when another local controller intentionally owns permission handling for that run. The hook CLI exits immediately without reading or forwarding the payload, so the agent continues without Open Island UI intervention.

`VIBE_ISLAND_SKIP=1` is also recognized as a legacy compatibility alias.

This is meant for per-process launches. Do not set it globally unless you want Open Island hooks disabled for every agent started from that environment.

## Codex Hooks (`--source codex`)

**Payload type**: `CodexHookPayload`  
**Source**: [`Sources/OpenIslandCore/CodexHooks.swift`](../Sources/OpenIslandCore/CodexHooks.swift)

### Events

| `hook_event_name` | When it fires | Notable fields |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Session starts or resumes (`source: "resume"` on resume) | `prompt`, `source` |
| `PreToolUse` | Before a shell command executes | `tool_name`, `tool_input.command`, `turn_id`, `tool_use_id` |
| `PermissionRequest` | Codex requests permission for a tool/action | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `turn_id` |
| `PostToolUse` | After a shell command completes | `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `tool_response`, `turn_id` |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User submits a new prompt | `prompt` |
| `Stop` | A turn completes | `last_assistant_message`, `stop_hook_active` |

### Default managed installation

The managed Codex hook installer (`CodexHookInstaller`) installs `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PermissionRequest`, and `Stop` by default. This keeps the lifecycle hooks low-noise while still allowing OpenIsland to broker Codex's first-class approval requests. Per-command `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` hooks remain opt-in because they can add terminal log noise.

The installer chooses the Codex hook feature flag that the local Codex CLI advertises. Newer Codex builds use `[features].hooks = true`; older builds use the legacy `[features].codex_hooks = true`. Status checks recognize both keys, and managed installs migrate between them when the local Codex version changes.

After hooks are installed or changed, Codex may require a manual trust review before running them. Open `/hooks` inside Codex CLI and approve the expected Open Island hook entries. This approval gate belongs to Codex and is not bypassed by Open Island.

The `CodexHookPayload` model and `BridgeServer` can parse richer events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`) when they are present in the hook payload, and will surface them in the UI if received. However, these per-tool lifecycle events are **not** installed by the managed installer and must be configured manually if desired.

> **Note on file-edit coverage**: Codex file edits may use internal apply-patch paths that do not emit `PreToolUse` events. File-edit approval should not be treated as guaranteed `PreToolUse` coverage; the current reliable coverage is command/shell-level events, depending on Codex hook configuration.

### Common payload fields

| JSON key | Swift property | Description |

| `terminal_session_id` | `terminalSessionID` | Terminal session identifier |
| `terminal_tty` | `terminalTTY` | TTY device path |
| `terminal_title` | `terminalTitle` | Tab / window title |

| `tool_response` | `toolResponse` | Tool output (JSON) |
| `prompt` | `prompt` | User prompt text |
| `last_assistant_message` | `lastAssistantMessage` | Last assistant message |
| `stop_hook_active` | `stopHookActive` | Whether the stop hook is active |

### Directive responses

#### `PreToolUse`

The app can block a command by writing this to stdout:

```json
{"decision": "block", "reason": "Blocked by Open Island"}
```

#### `PermissionRequest`

The managed `PermissionRequest` hook has a 1-hour timeout so the user can approve or deny from the UI.

Allow:

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow"
    }
  }
}
```

Deny:

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "deny",
      "message": "User denied the permission request"
    }
  }
}
```

All other Codex events require no stdout response.

### PreToolUse directive response

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "suppressOutput": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "allow" | "deny" | "ask",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "reason shown to the agent",

    "additionalContext": "extra context injected into the turn"
  }
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `permissionDecision` | `allow` — proceed; `deny` — block; `ask` — let the agent ask the user |
| `permissionDecisionReason` | Human-readable reason forwarded to the agent |
| `updatedInput` | Replace the tool's input parameters (optional) |
| `additionalContext` | Inject additional context into the turn (optional) |

### PermissionRequest directive response

The `PermissionRequest` event has a **24-hour timeout** to allow the user to review and approve in the UI.

Allow:

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "suppressOutput": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "allow",
      "updatedInput": { ... },
      "updatedPermissions": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}
```

Deny:

```json
{
  "continue": true,
  "suppressOutput": true,
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PermissionRequest",
    "decision": {
      "behavior": "deny",
      "message": "User denied the permission request",
      "interrupt": false
    }
  }
}
```

Setting `interrupt: true` terminates the current agent turn immediately.

## Gemini CLI Hooks (`--source gemini`)

**Payload type**: `GeminiHookPayload`  
**Source**: [`Sources/OpenIslandCore/GeminiHooks.swift`](../Sources/OpenIslandCore/GeminiHooks.swift)

### Events

| `hook_event_name` | When it fires | Current OpenIsland behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `SessionStart` | Session starts or resumes | Creates or restores the Gemini session, title, jump target, and transcript metadata |
| `BeforeAgent` | Gemini starts handling a prompt / turn | Marks the session running, updates prompt text, refreshes terminal metadata |
| `AfterAgent` | Gemini finishes a turn | Marks the turn completed and emits a completion card |
| `SessionEnd` | Gemini reports the session ended | Marks the hook-managed session ended and removes it from active visibility |
| `Notification` | Gemini emits a notification message | Updates the session summary / activity text without blocking the agent |

### Common payload fields

| JSON key | Swift property | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `cwd` | `cwd` | Working directory |
| `hook_event_name` | `hookEventName` | Event type |
| `session_id` | `sessionID` | Session identifier |
| `transcript_path` | `transcriptPath` | Gemini transcript file path |
| `timestamp` | `timestamp` | Hook timestamp |
| `prompt` | `prompt` | User prompt text |
| `prompt_response` | `promptResponse` | Gemini response text |
| `source` | `source` | Session start source |
| `reason` | `reason` | Session-end reason |
| `notification_type` | `notificationType` | Notification category |
| `message` | `message` | Notification message |
| `details` | `details` | Structured notification payload |
| `stop_hook_active` | `stopHookActive` | Whether Gemini stop hook support is active |
| `terminal_app` | `terminalApp` | Terminal name |
| `terminal_session_id` | `terminalSessionID` | Terminal session identifier |
| `terminal_tty` | `terminalTTY` | TTY device path |
| `terminal_title` | `terminalTitle` | Tab / window title |

### Current feature coverage

- Session lifecycle ingestion for Gemini CLI via `OpenIslandHooks --source gemini`
- Session list and island visibility updates from Gemini hook events
- Prompt / response metadata capture for completion cards and session details
- Terminal jump metadata enrichment for Terminal.app, iTerm2, Ghostty, and other supported terminals
- Process-assisted liveness matching so active Gemini CLI sessions can stay visible even when hook traffic is sparse

### Current limitations

- Gemini hooks are currently treated as fire-and-forget. OpenIsland does not send Gemini-specific approval or modification directives back to stdout.
- Gemini hook payloads sometimes include a duplicated copy of the final response body, often with whitespace-only differences. OpenIsland applies a best-effort compatibility pass before rendering completion content, but the result is not guaranteed to be perfect for every response shape.
- Gemini support is currently limited to the hook events and UI/session behaviors listed above. It does not yet match the richer permission / interaction flows available for Claude Code or OpenCode.

## Antigravity CLI Hooks (`--source antigravity`)

**Payload type**: `AntigravityHookPayload` (dedicated decode path)  
**Source**: [`Sources/OpenIslandCore/AntigravityHooks.swift`](../Sources/OpenIslandCore/AntigravityHooks.swift)

The Antigravity CLI (`agy`) publishes its own hook protocol. Unlike Claude
Code and Gemini CLI, a payload does not identify its own event and carries no
`cwd`; the event travels through the `--event` CLI argument (each event is a
separate command entry) and the workspace is recovered from the parent `agy`
process via `lsof`, with `workspacePaths` as a fallback when populated.

### Configuration file

agy reads hooks from the shared customization config
`~/.gemini/config/hooks.json` — a JSON object of named hook groups. Open
Island owns the `"open-island"` group and leaves every other group untouched.
`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` handlers sit behind a `matcher` regex group;
`PreInvocation`/`Stop` handlers form flat lists. Handler `command` strings run
through `sh -c`, so the binary path is single-quoted. agy loads `hooks.json`
at process start: installs only affect sessions launched afterwards.

### Managed events

| Event | Mapping in Open Island |
| :--- | :--- |
| `PreInvocation` | Creates (if new) the session keyed by `conversationId` and marks it running |
| `PreToolUse` | Live activity update from `toolCall` (`toolSummary`/`CommandLine`) |
| `PostToolUse` | Activity update with tool outcome (`error` empty string = success) |
| `Stop` | Turn completed → completion card |

`PostInvocation` is deliberately not installed (low-noise footprint), and
agy has no session-end event — retirement relies on the passive discovery
idle timeout and process liveness.

### Stdout contract (important)

`PreToolUse` entries must write **nothing** to stdout: agy treats a JSON
object without a `decision` field as a deny, while empty output falls through
to the normal permission flow. All other managed events acknowledge with `{}`.

### Coexistence with passive discovery

Hook sessions and passively discovered sessions share the `conversationId`
key, so they merge into one row. The passive scan refreshes presentation
metadata (title from the summaries DB, workspace from history) but never
flips a hook-completed session back to running, and jump targets merge
field-by-field instead of wholesale.

## ZCode Hooks (`--source zcode`)

**Payload type**: `ClaudeHookPayload` (shared decode path, like the Claude Code forks)  
**Source**: [`Sources/OpenIslandCore/ZCodeHookInstaller.swift`](../Sources/OpenIslandCore/ZCodeHookInstaller.swift)

ZCode (Z.AI) publishes Claude-Code-compatible hooks: the stdin JSON carries the
snake_case Claude fields (`hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `transcript_path`,
`cwd`, `prompt`, `tool_name`, `tool_input`, `stop_hook_active`, ...) alongside
ZCode's own camelCase aliases. Open Island therefore reuses the Claude decode
path and only implements a dedicated installer.

### Configuration file

ZCode reads hooks from `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` — not from a Claude-style
`settings.json`. Hook groups nest under `hooks.events.<Event>` and the whole
hook system must be switched on with `hooks.enabled: true`. Entries use
ZCode's `process` type (bare executable path + `args` array) because ZCode
does not evaluate `command` entries through a shell unless the entry opts in
via `shell` — a shell-quoted `command` string corrupts argv and the hook
never runs:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "events": {
      "SessionStart": [
        { "hooks": [ { "type": "process", "command": "<hooks-binary>", "args": ["--source", "zcode"], "timeoutMs": 45000, "enabled": true } ] }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Managed installation

`ZCodeHookInstallationManager` installs `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`,
`PermissionRequest` (1 hour), and `Stop` into `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` and
sets `hooks.enabled = true`. The manifest
(`~/.zcode/cli/open-island-zcode-install.json`) records the pre-install
`hooks.enabled` value so uninstall restores the user's original state.
Per-tool events (`PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PostToolUseFailure`) stay
opt-in to keep the footprint low-noise.

Legacy installs that still hold `command`-type entries (shell-quoted path)
are treated as not installed: startup auto-install and the Settings pane
rewrite them as `process` entries, and uninstall still recognizes the legacy
form via marker matching.

ZCode snapshots hook configuration when a session starts, so installs and
uninstalls apply to sessions launched afterwards; running sessions are
unaffected.

### Desktop app sessions

When ZCode.app (bundle `dev.zcode.app`) drives the CLI, hooks run as TTY-less
subprocesses. The hook runtime tags those payloads `terminal_app: "ZCode.app"`
via `__CFBundleIdentifier`, and liveness follows the desktop app instead of a
terminal process (same model as Claude Desktop's local agent mode). Jump-back
activates ZCode.app; sessions started in a real terminal keep full terminal
jump targeting.

**Known limitation (verified 2026-09-02, ZCode CLI 0.16.5 / app 3.10.2):**
ZCode.app sessions do not execute hooks from `~/.zcode/cli/config.json` —
only terminal CLI sessions load user-config hooks. A live probe (fresh
app session, real prompt, `process`-type entries) produced no hook
executions and no Open Island session. The app surfaces its own
workspace-hook mechanism (project `zcode.json` / `.zcode/config.json` with
an in-app trust review) instead.

### Workspace hooks (`zcode.json`)

Open Island adopts that workspace mechanism for app sessions
([ADR 0001](adr/0001-zcode-workspace-hooks-managed-zcode-json.md)). When
process monitoring sees a ZCode session process, its working directory is
resolved to a workspace root (first `.git` ancestor, mirroring ZCode's own
config discovery) and the user is asked once per workspace whether to
enable monitoring. On confirm, Open Island writes a managed `zcode.json`
at the root — same four lifecycle events as the user-level install, same
`process`-type entries — and appends a local-only exclude line
(`.git/info/exclude`) because the hook command embeds a machine-specific
absolute path.

ZCode gates workspace hooks behind a per-workspace trust digest keyed on
the full declaration (command, args, timeouts, positions). Consequences:

- The file is deliberately **write-once**: while an install is current it
  is never rewritten, and status checks match the expected binary path
  exactly. Only a drifted managed command (moved binary) or a missing
  file triggers a rewrite — which invalidates the trust and re-surfaces
  the guide ("Settings → Hooks → Workspace"; the review prompt does not
  reliably reappear on its own). User-edited configs are left untouched.
- Disabling ZCode support removes every managed write via the managed
  writes registry (`zcode-workspace-writes.json` in Application Support);
  orphaned trust grants inside ZCode are inert without the config file.
- Residual risk (accepted, ADR 0001): if a future ZCode release makes app
  sessions load user-config hooks alongside workspace hooks, lifecycle
  events would be reported twice. No duplicate-event defense is built —
  code inspection (2026-09-02) found terminal sessions never register
  workspace hooks and app sessions never ran user-config hooks.

## Timeout Policy

| Source | Event | Timeout |
|---|---|---|
| Codex | `PermissionRequest` | **1 hour** (awaits human approval) |
| Codex | All other managed events | **45 seconds** |
| Claude Code | `PermissionRequest` | **24 hours** (awaits human approval) |
| Claude Code | All other events | **45 seconds** |
| Gemini CLI | All events | Bridge default |
| ZCode | `PermissionRequest` | **1 hour** (awaits human approval) |
| ZCode | All other managed events | **45 seconds** |

---

## Terminal Auto-detection

The hook process infers the terminal type from environment variables at runtime:

| Environment variable | Inferred terminal |
|---|---|
| `ITERM_SESSION_ID` or `LC_TERMINAL=iTerm2` | `iTerm` |
| `CMUX_WORKSPACE_ID` or `CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` | `cmux` |
| `GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR` | `Ghostty` |
| `WARP_IS_LOCAL_SHELL_SESSION` | `Warp` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal` | `Terminal` |
| `TERM_PROGRAM=WezTerm` | `WezTerm` |

For iTerm, Terminal, and Ghostty the process additionally runs an AppleScript query to obtain the session ID, TTY, and window title — used to power the "jump back to terminal" feature. The `cmux` terminal uses `CMUX_SURFACE_ID` instead of AppleScript.

---

## Antigravity CLI (passive discovery — no hooks)

Antigravity (`agy`) shares the `~/.gemini` root directory with Gemini CLI but
nothing else: its settings live in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`
and its hooks use a dedicated named-group `hooks.json` (see
[Antigravity CLI Hooks](#antigravity-cli-hooks---source-antigravity)), not
Gemini CLI's `SessionStart` / `BeforeAgent` / `AfterAgent` / `SessionEnd`
vocabulary. Active hook ingestion ships alongside passive discovery; the
passive layer stays valuable because it works with no configuration and
covers sessions started before an install:

| Source | Used for |
|---|---|
| `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversations/<uuid>.db` | Conversation existence and activity (file mtime) |
| `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/history.jsonl` | Latest prompt text, timestamp, and workspace per conversation |
| `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/conversation_summaries.db` | Optional titles and workspace URIs |
| `ps` (process matching on `agy`) | Liveness — a live process keeps the workspace-matched session visible |

Sessions whose activity went quiet for more than 10 minutes are marked
completed; sessions older than 24 hours stop being reported. The
`presence/<uuid>.lock` files are deliberately ignored for liveness because
stale locks linger after the CLI exits.
